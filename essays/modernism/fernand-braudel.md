##### **AN INTRODUCTION TO THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF ONE OF THE 20TH CENTURY'S MOST IMPORTANT HISTORIANS**


Have you ever wondered how *where* you live has influenced *who* you are? Are you a person of the desert, the mountains, the sea? Have you ever questioned the relativity of time or thought of time in terms of its relationship to space? I know I have, and that is why I was so drawn to the famed [Annales School](https://unm-historiography.github.io/intro-guide/essays/modernism/annales-school.html) historian **Fernand Paul Braudel (1902-1985)**. That and the fact that he was a wonderful storyteller who wrote like a poet. I hope that his life and legacy inspire you as they have me. 

Fernand Braudel was many things: a teacher, writer, prisoner, husband, and historian. He was also a man who rejected the significance of individual people and events. For more than fifty years he advocated a history “based on a consideration of physical and material constraints, one in which the individual was subsumed by the environment” (Hufton, 209). What would he think of someone writing his story, searching for meaning in the course of his years instead of in the landscapes he inhabited? Many scholars have argued that Braudel was the most significant historian of the 20th century, but how should he be remembered considering his personal opposition to the histories of ‘great men’? This essay examines the influence he had on historiography in the face of that ironic paradox and argues that **Braudel’s work galvanized a new geographical, quantitative, and long duration study of history.**

Fernand Paul Braudel was born on August 24, 1902 in [Lumeville](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lum%C3%A9ville-en-Ornois,+55130+Gondrecourt-le-Ch%C3%A2teau,+France/@48.4672851,5.4120253,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47eca374c738ce5f:0x105f0bece0166c42!8m2!3d48.467287!4d5.4295349), a humble village of two hundred people in north eastern France. Raised from an early age by his paternal grandmother, Braudel moved to the outskirts of Paris in 1908. While his father taught in the city, Braudel attended first the [Lycee Voltaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyc%C3%A9e_Voltaire_(Paris)) and then the [Sorbonne](http://lettres.sorbonne-universite.fr/), where he got a degree in history “without difficulty, but also without much enjoyment” (Braudel, 449). Braudel noted the instruction of French economic historian [Henri Hauser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Hauser) as his one agreeable memory (449) at the Sorbonne. Despite an urban education, he was ultimately more influenced by his earliest years in rural France. **Braudel himself credited his upbringing in the countryside—where he experienced first hand the influence of things like crop cycles and weather patterns on the history of his village—as the foundation for much of his geographical historical perspectives later in life.** 


### Algeria and Brazil

Upon graduation, Braudel was assigned a position teaching history in [Constantine, Algeria](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Constantine,+Algeria/@36.3539041,6.5073923,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x12f17717c4785627:0x25fb307fd08801a!8m2!3d36.360155!4d6.642433). As a man in his early twenties, Braudel delighted in the city, the Sahara, and in teaching, despite the fact that he was instructing his students “a superficial history of events…of happenings, of politics, of great men” (Braudel, 450). In the summers, when school was not in session, Braudel spent countless hours at the archives working on a thesis surrounding King Phillip II of Spain. **Using an old film camera he purchased from an American cameraman, Braudel took upwards of 2,000 photos a day of documents in the archives, inadvertently becoming “the first user of microfilms”** (Braudel, 452). This methodology alone changed the way professionals and novices alike do history, but that was only the beginning. His time in Algeria challenged his Eurocentric view of world and opened his eyes to influences on the other side of the Mediterranean.

In 1935 Braudel accepted a teaching position in [Sao Paulo, Brazil](https://www.google.com/maps/place/S%C3%A3o+Paulo,+State+of+S%C3%A3o+Paulo,+Brazil/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x94ce448183a461d1:0x9ba94b08ff335bae?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwitjbbRqeblAhVOEawKHYznAOwQ8gEwKnoECBAQBA). For three years he taught a course on the history of civilization and continued his work in the archives. **Braudel claimed that from Brazil “he could see the Mediterranean from outside as a whole” while also getting a glimpse into the past by observing the “still surviving forms of social control and modes of exploitation of the land and of the labor force” reminiscent of Medieval Europe** (Aymard, 18). 

Another significant result of Braudel’s time in Brazil was his introduction to the renowned French historian [Lucien Febvre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucien_Febvre) in October of 1937. Both men were on board a ship heading back to Europe, Braudel after teaching in Sao Paulo and Febvre after lecturing in Buenos Aires. After twenty days on the water together, Braudel had become “more than a companion to Lucien Febvre…a little like a son (Braudel, 452). By 1939, after more than a decade in the archives, Braudel was ready to start writing his book on the Mediterranean. But that same year he was called to serve in the French army.  


### As a Prisoner of War

From 1940 to 1945, Braudel was a prisoner of war in Nazi Germany. He served at two separate camps—Mainz and Lubeck—finding solace in his writing and in lecturing to fellow prisoners. In his *Personal Testimony*, Braudel writes of the impact that the burden of time and the times had on his historiographical approach. “My vision of history took on its definitive form without my being entirely aware of it…partly as a direct existential response to the tragic times I was passing through” (Braudel, 454). **He was able to survive the horrors of the world around him by denying the importance of individual occurrences in favor of histories written around longer time scales.** During this period, Braudel wrote “600,000 words of text from memory” (Hufton, 208) on school notebooks he sent out to Febvre. These would become the draft of his magnum opus, *The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Time of Phillip II*, the book that would define not only the rest of his life but also a shift in 20th century historiography.  

### Professional Life


The [companion article](https://unm-historiography.github.io/intro-guide/essays/modernism/annales-school.html) on this site titled “The Annales School” details the influence and implications of these French thinkers; however, the Annales deserves additional attention here for Braudel’s role in its second wave. Upon returning from Brazil, Braudel worked under Lucien Febvre and [Marc Bloch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Bloch), the original founders of the *Annales* [journal](http://annales.ehess.fr/index.php?220) that would inspire the movement. His association with Febvre continued even during his time as a prisoner of war as Braudel sent draft after draft of *The Mediterranean* to Febvre for safekeeping and review. With the publishing of that work in 1949, Braudel gained widespread notoriety and became the preeminent historian in post-war Europe. Following the death of Febvre in 1956, Braudel took over as director of The Annales. In 1968, “he entrusted his editorial responsibilities to a younger generation of historians…but maintained officially up to his own death the direction” (Aymard, 14) of the Annales.

Outside of his time with The Annales, Braudel worked as a professor at the College de France, served as president of the VI section of the Ecole Pratique de Hautes Etudes, and director of the Masion de Sciences de l’Homme (Hufton, 208).  All the while, he continued work on a 1966 revision of *The Mediterranean* as well as a massive new history on Capitalism which he would publish in 1967 under the title *Civilization and Capitalism*. *The Identity of France*, published posthumously in 1986, examines the history of Braudel’s motherland and is our final glimpse into the mind of “the greatest and most influential historian of our time” (Hufton, 208).

What began as a thesis on the life of King Phillip II of Spain ultimately became a thousand plus page discussion on the history of the Mediterranean. Braudel introduces a three part notion of time in which common time was set on one side so that the long duration effects of geography, climate, and sociology came to the forefront (Hufton, 112).

**The Braudelian perspective of time centers around the idea that all historical events could be examined in distinct time scales: the *longue duree*, the *moyenne duree*, and the *courte duree*.** “The longue duree, virtually boundless time, perhaps extending over centuries of common time during which the parameters of human existence were unchanged” (Hufton, 112) was the most influential scale according to Braudel. The moyenne duree relates to “anything in common time perhaps from fifty years to a century” (Hufton, 112) where shifts in trade cycles or urban development are witnessed, for example. Finally, the courte duree refers to “phenomena such as abnormal harvests or short industrial slumps or temporary dislocation which might…be the product of war, occupation, etc.” (112). 

*The Mediterranean*, is a story of life during the era of King Phillip from all of these time scales showing "how, in the lands around the ever-changing and never-changing sea, time and space, history and geography together shaped one coherent past, present, and future” (Marino, 649). **His emphasis on the longue duree devalued individual people and events**, drawing some criticism from his contemporaries, which I will address below. Braudel’s three part temporal structure was a revolutionary idea. At a time when other historians were focusing largely on military campaigns, political successions, and biographies—concerns of the medium and short durations—**Braudel offered an epic alternative in the form of a total history** of the Mediterranean. His scale, in terms of both time and space, was enormous when compared to his contemporaries. Because of that, he was able to ask different and bigger questions, look for larger trends, and consider the roles that factors like geography and climate play in the shaping of nations and cultures. 

The fact that *The Mediterranean* has been translated into languages as diverse as Chinese, Greek, Hungarian, Dutch, Japanese, and others, is evidence of the widespread interest and appreciation of Braudel's innovative historiographical approach. A quick search in the library database revealed a diverse variety of scholarship employing his three part temporal approach to history.

Suffice it so say that I did not read this gargantuan three volume set on the history of pre-industrial western civilization, and I do not want to spend too much time in the details of this work. However, it is important to know the essence of Braudel’s historical argument about the nature of Capitalism in order to understand its implications on the production of history. Most significantly, Braudel makes a stark distinction between the (free)market and Capitalism. **In his words the market is transparent whereas Capitalism is speculative, the market is structured around competition, Capitalism around control and monopolization, and the market is domain of regular people with relatively small profits and Capitalism is the domain of the powerful with exceptional profits** (Wallerstein, 357).  Another important distinction that Braudel makes is that Capitalism has flexibility to adjust depending on where the money is, and that its adaptability supersedes its specialization. 

So why does that all matter? Because it rejected pretty much the entire corpus of economic history up to that point! See if you can follow me on this one. Traditional economic historiography advocated a narrative of economic evolution following the general form of: generic, simple peasant society gets exploited by landlords leading to the eventual development of a middle class which in turn develops capitalism which then leads to both the Industrial and French Revolutions “which together constitute a great temporal divide of world history at the turn of the nineteenth century” (Wallerstein, 359). Let that settle in. **Braudel argued against that historical mythology, calling instead for an analysis that revealed the historic role of monopolists working against the market.** 

Braudel also made some interesting observations with regards to both language and time. He challenged the periodization we have created within economic history and theory. Specifically our use of words like *pre-industrial* and *post-industrial* gives power to what he might characterize as a false narrative: “the break between medieval and modern times” based on a free market capitalism (Wallerstein, 359). 

### Braudelain Methods

  text="I consciously set forth in search of a historical language-the most profound I could grasp or invent-in order to present unchanging...conditions which stubbornly assert themselves over and over again.  
  (Braudel,454)"
  %}

Braudel’s methods were both familiar and innovative. He relied heavily on archival research but also on his memory and the power of storytelling. He was a historian at heart but also employed other social science methodologies, declaring that all **“temporalities were at work in any historical event, and that different disciplines specialize in different temporalities**—geography in the long duration, economics in the middle duration” (Caygill, 157). For Braudel, history was the mediator between other disciplines. 

As a professor, Braudel also practiced controversial methodologies. He specifically selected students based on their research plans instead of on their transcripts, emphasizing their futures over their pasts, even though it contradicted with established norms of the academy. And, let’s not forget his role in the rise of microfilm. You can thank Braudel when you are squinting over blurry lines of newsprint in your local library’s basement. 

### Criticisms and Conclusion

Despite his renown and influence, Braudel also had some tough critics. The two main areas of contention in his work revolve around the idea of *total histories* generally and his three-part temporal structure specifically. American historian and two-time Pulitzer Prize winner [Bernard Bailyn]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Bailyn ) reviewed *The Mediterranean* following its English translation in 1973. He wrote, “What is painfully lacking from this huge, rambling book is the integration of its parts that could result from the posing of proper historical questions” (Marino, 629). Bailyn and others felt that his division of time made his narratives disjointed while his emphasis on the *longue duree* meant that he almost never wrote about actual people (quite a taboo practice for a historian).

Others, like [Carlo Ginzberg]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Ginzburg) and the Italian school of *microstoria*, rejected his philosophy of total histories. They argued that total histories were either impossible or problematic, for practical reasons on the first account and theoretical and ethical ones on the second.  Choosing instead the opposite side of the spectrum in terms of scope, historians of microstoria worked in extremely specific spatial and temporal scales, focusing on the lives of individuals in particular contexts. 

Despite these criticisms, Braudel remains one of the most defining voices of 20th century historiography. His influence inspired a shift towards more interdisciplinary historical research, quantitative methodologies, and in increase in the study of global histories. **As spatial and digital histories expand as a result of new technologies, what methods might we integrate from Braudel? How can his theories inspire research in climate change, migration, big data, and other contemporary concerns?**
